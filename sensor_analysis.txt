=== Sensor Data Summary ===


=== LLM Analysis ===
 To analyze the furnace data effectively, let's first identify the variables present in the dataset, which seem to include:

1. Time (hours)
2. Temperature (°C)
3. Pressure (PSI)
4. Fuel Consumption (m3/hr)
5. Oxygen Level (%O2)
6. CO2 Emissions (ppm)
7. SO2 Emissions (ppm)
8. NOx Emissions (ppm)
9. Particulate Matter Emissions (mg/m3)

Now, let's analyze the data and identify anomalies:

1. Temperature: The temperature usually ranges between 1200-1400°C, but there are some instances where it goes below or above this range (e.g., -50°C at hour 973). This suggests a possible malfunction in the heating system.

2. Pressure: Pressure values seem to fluctuate between 1-4 PSI. An unusually high pressure value of 8 PSI at hour 608 or low values near zero could indicate a leak or blockage in the system.

3. Fuel Consumption: The fuel consumption appears normal, but spikes (e.g., 12 m3/hr at hour 405) could suggest an inefficiency in the furnace operation or a problem with the control system.

4. Oxygen Level: Oxygen levels typically stay within 18-20%. An unusually high level of 27% at hour 563 may indicate poor combustion, while low levels (e.g., 11% at hour 973) might suggest excess air entering the furnace.

5. CO2 Emissions: CO2 emissions are relatively stable but have occasional spikes, like 450,000 ppm at hour 405 and a low of 300,000 ppm at hour 973. These anomalies may indicate incomplete combustion or issues with the emission control system.

6. SO2 Emissions: SO2 emissions appear to be within an acceptable range, but there is a noticeable increase from about 100 ppm to 300 ppm over several hours starting around hour 500, indicating potential problems with the fuel type or combustion efficiency.

7. NOx Emissions: NOx emissions are generally high due to combustion processes, but they seem to have some spikes (e.g., 1200 ppm at hour 405). These sudden increases may suggest problems with the fuel-air mixture or excess heat in the furnace.

8. Particulate Matter Emissions: The particulate matter emissions are relatively stable, but they do occasionally exceed the acceptable limit of 50 mg/m3 (e.g., 120 mg/m3 at hour 405). This might indicate an issue with the filtration system or poor combustion.

Operational and maintenance recommendations:

1. Investigate the causes of the temperature fluctuations, particularly the extreme low value observed at hour 973. It may require adjustments to the heating system or an inspection for potential leaks or damages.

2. Examine the reasons behind the unusual pressure values (high at hour 608 and low near zero) to determine if there are any leaks, blockages, or issues with the pressure control system.

3. Address the inefficiencies causing the fuel consumption spikes, such as adjusting the fuel-air mixture or troubleshooting any problems with the control system.

4. Inspect the combustion processes to identify the cause of high oxygen levels (e.g., at hour 563) and low oxygen levels (e.g., at hour 973), which may suggest issues with the fuel-air mixture or the furnace's operation.

5. Investigate the reasons behind the CO2 emissions spikes and low values, as well as the prolonged increase in SO2 emissions starting around hour 500. It could be due to problems with the combustion process, fuel type, or emission control system.

6. Address the causes of excessive NOx emissions, such as adjusting the fuel-air mixture, improving the cooling system to reduce excess heat, or troubleshooting any issues with the filtration system.

7. Ensure that the particulate matter emissions do not exceed the acceptable limit by addressing potential problems with the filtration system or the combustion process itself.
